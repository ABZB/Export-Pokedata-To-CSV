Instructions:

1) Copy and paste the list of TM/HM moves from your mod (just copy from pk3ds) into column B of the tm_hm_special_tutor_list

2) If you have renamed any Pokemon, Moves, Abilities, or items, or inserted any new ones, modify the respective csv files accordingly. The pokemon_list for each game contains the default listing. The Pokemon need to be in the same row as their personal index number in pk3ds.

3) Run the program, and choose the game you are generating documents for (XY, ORAS, SM, or USUM)

4) Select the target folder (same folder you select with pk3ds)

5) You can choose either or both of a comprehensive summary (designed for looking up things like movesets, or for hooking into another spreadsheet or program to do things like search for Pokemon with specific properties) and a simple report (just a table of Type, Base Stats, and Abilities)

6) You're done!
